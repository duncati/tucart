# TU Shopping Cart
This package is a rough start at a Shopping Cart API that persists to a TBD DB.

The work is quite incomplete.... I coded from a CDC perspective (as opposed to TDD). Having run out of time, I did not get to write any test code.

What is done? A few endpoints to handle getCartItems, addItem, and removeItem. There is minimal exception handling and if there were a DB the code might actually work. :)
